# Notes

1. The act of speaking into a system tends to increase the level of psychological safety for the speaker
2. Psychological safety is based on perception and not reality
3. Psychological safety usually likes in the intra/inter-personal
4. A definition of psychological safety by Amy Edmondson: "a shared belief that the group is safe for interpersonal risk-taking"
5. According to Amy Edmondson, psychological safety should be a means to having standards:

| | | | |
| ---:| :---: | :---: |:---|
| | **High** | **Safety** | |
| **Low** | `A` | `B` | **High** |
| **Standards** | `C` | `D` | **Standards** |
| | **Low** | **Safety** | |
